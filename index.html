                <h2>Information : </h2>
                <p>A sandwich is a food prepared by placing different kinds of foods between two pieces of bread. The
                    pieces of bread in a sandwich are referred to as slices or sheets of bread. Between the slices of
                    bread, people often add in vegetables, meat, or cheese. The sandwich is thought to have been made
                    first for the Earl of Sandwich, hence the name.
                    <br>
                    Many people enjoy the sandwich as it is easy and quick to make in a hurry. Also, the sandwich can be
                    easily eaten with one hand without utensils which allows consumers to have a hand free to do other
                    things. Some people prefer to eat a sandwich with both hands.

                    In many countries, children eat sandwiches for lunch at school. The sandwiches are put in a lunchbox
                    and often wrapped in cling film to keep them fresh.A sandwich is not limited to a single layer of
                    filling between two pieces of bread. It can have more than one layer of filling and bread. Each
                    layer of filling is commonly referred to as a "deck". For instance, a single decker sandwich would
                    be the standard two slices of bread and one layer of filling. A double decker sandwich will have
                    three slices of bread with two layers of fillings. Generally one piece, is one piece of bread cut in
                    two with a filling between each piece. <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich">Read

                <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
                    typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese,
                    lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise,
                    relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently
                    placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.
                    <br>
                    Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and other restaurants. There are
                    many international and regional variations of hamburger. Some of the largest multinational fast-food
                    chains have a burger as one of their core products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's Whopper
                    have become global icons of American culture.Various non-specific claims of the invention relate to
                    the term <strong>"hamburger steak"</strong> without mention of its being a sandwich. The first
                    printed American menu which listed hamburger is said to be an 1834 menu from Delmonico's in New
                    York. However, the printer of the original menu was not in business in 1834. In 1889, a menu from
                    Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item. <a

                <p>Dosas originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins are unknown. According to
                    historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka.However,
                    according to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was
                    already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE.Achaya states that the
                    earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th
                    century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.

                    In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's
                    association with Udupi restaurants.The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier
                    version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka.A recipe for dosa can be found in
                    Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from
                    present-day Karnataka. <a

                <p>Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic,
                    coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest
                    sales in the world market for hot drinks.
                    <br>
                    The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The
                    beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before
                    being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced
                    coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French
                    press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are
                    often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
                    <br>
                    Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions
                    around the Red Sea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">Read more...</a>
